<h2> About Me </h2>
<p>
Hello, I am currently a full-time student at Brooklyn College majoring in
Computer Science with a minor in Multimedia Computing! I spend a lot of time
writing code in java and recently, HTML and CSS. Being a traditional realism
artist, I love creating visuals and I feel this CISC 1600 class has been
perfect so far in helping me realize the creative aspects of programming.
I'm very motivated to further my knowledge in front and back-end web
development. Hopefully, I will be able to create aesthetically pleasing and
functional websites in the near future!
</p>

<p>
Aside from my studies, I love sports and athletics. I've been very active
since a young age, playing basketball, swimming, football, training martial
arts and in the recent years, going rock climbing. For me, nothing compares to
the great outdoors and beauty of nature, so a perfect vacation would be to
combine both athletics and nature's incredible scenery. Imagine rock climbing
the mountains of Yosemite National Park or feeling the rush and freedom while
skiing down a snow covered mountain.
